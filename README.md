# RISC-IV hobby 4-bit RISC minicomputer

## Under construction!

I'm in the process of uploading files. The computer is not finished, but I've made good progress and have already created some documentation and support files.

## Overview

RISC-IV is a 4-bit RISC minicomputer built from logic chips and memory. I built it as a hobby project, and its design will continue to evolve. I've enlisted my son to figure out how to program it, which is going to be an awkward mess.

### Here are some specs:

* Harvard architecture
* 4k x 8 bit program EEPROM
* 128 x 7 bit RAM and stack-shaped object (SSO)
* Input and output ports
* BCD arithmetic
* 2 instructions
